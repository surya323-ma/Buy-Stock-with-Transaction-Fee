You are given an array arr[], in which arr[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day and an integer k represents a transaction fee. Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self,arr,k):
        #Code here
        
        hold = -arr[0]
        not_hold = 0
        
        for price in arr:
            
            hold = max(hold, not_hold - price)
            not_hold = max(not_hold, hold + price - k)
            
        return not_hold
